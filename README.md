Today’s productivity tools are built on outdated assumptions that separate tasks, events, and projects into different apps—forcing people to mentally stitch everything together. But in real life, tasks take time, events require action, and projects are simply clusters of both. They’re all the same kind of object: a commitment with different attributes. My prototype introduces a new model that unifies tasks and events into a single data structure, letting you plan, schedule, and track work the way it actually exists. No more juggling calendars and to-dos—just one system that reflects reality instead of abstracting it away.
