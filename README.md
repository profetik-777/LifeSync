Why LifeSync: 

Today’s productivity tools are built on outdated assumptions that separate tasks, events, and projects into different apps—forcing people to mentally stitch everything together. But in real life, tasks take time, events require action, and projects are simply clusters of both. They’re all the same kind of object: a commitment with different attributes. My prototype introduces a new model that unifies tasks and events into a single data structure, letting you plan, schedule, and track work the way it actually exists. No more juggling calendars and to-dos—just one system that reflects reality instead of abstracting it away.


LifeSync's Goal:

What if we had a digital productivity tool that helped us keep insync with life's demands? What if that tool can also help us keep track of all the areas that are important but sometimes forgotten about due to the demands of life? And what if this app actually mapped to reality with how we engage with tasks, reminders, notes, and appointments? That is LifeSync's goal. A productivity web app that merges task management and notes and fuses it with calendar functionality. 

Organize your life across seven themed areas and seamlessly bridges tasks, events, and notes in a way that actually makes sense for the modern world.
