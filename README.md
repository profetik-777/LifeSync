# 🌐 LifeSync

*A unified productivity system that treats tasks, events, and notes as one seamless workflow.*

---

## 🚀 Why LifeSync

Most productivity tools are built on outdated assumptions that split tasks, events, and projects into separate apps—forcing you to mentally stitch everything together.

But in real life:

- ⏱️ **Tasks take time**
- 🎟️ **Events require action**
- 📁 **Projects are clusters of both**

They’re all the same kind of object: **a commitment with different attributes.**

**LifeSync** introduces a unified model where tasks and events share a single data structure, letting you plan, schedule, and track work exactly as it exists. No more juggling calendars, to-do apps, and notes—just one integrated system that reflects reality.

---

## 🌱 LifeSync’s Goal

**LifeSync** helps you stay *in sync* with life’s demands—both urgent and important.  
It brings together:

- 📝 **Tasks**
- 📔 **Notes**
- 📆 **Calendar interactions**

…into one modern, intuitive workflow.

Organize everything across seven life domains while seamlessly bridging tasks, events, and notes in a way that finally makes sense.
